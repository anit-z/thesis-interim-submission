## **SER Credit Rating – Interim Thesis Submission**

Description

This repository contains the interim submission of Tiantian Zhang's Master's thesis at the University of Groningen (2025).    
The project explores the use of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) for correlating credit ratings based on acoustic and semantic features extracted from speech.

## **Requirements**

This project requires Python 3.12 and the packages listed in requirements.txt.    
Main dependencies include:

transformers ≥ 4.52.0  
datasets ≥ 3.6.0  
torch  
pandas ≥ 2.2.3  
numpy ≥ 2.2.6  
tqdm  
matplotlib ≥ 3.10.3  
pydub  
opensmile (for audio feature extraction)

Install them all with:

pip install \-r requirements.txt

## **How to Run**

### **1\. Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/anit-z/thesis-interim-submission.git  
cd thesis-interim-submission

### **2\. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

python3 \-m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate

### **3\. Install dependencies**

pip install \-r requirements.txt

### **4\. Run a script (example)**


python scripts/your\_script.py

Replace `your_script.py` with the actual script name you want to execute.

## **Project Highlights**

* Utilizes both **acoustic** (e.g., low-level descriptors via openSMILE) and **semantic** (e.g., transformer embeddings) features from speech.  
* Combines speech signals with financial indicators.  
* Modular codebase: allows easy experimentation with different models and features.
